IT IS A SIMPLE PLUGIN FOR MINECRAFT 1.12.2!

TO USE THIS PLUGIN JUST MAKE A NEW PROJECT IN ECLIPSE, PLACE THE "plugin.yml" FILE IN THE ROOT FOLDER AND PUT THE "TREE.java" FILE IN THE "src\\(default package)" FOLDER!
THEN YOU NEED TO DOWNLOAD THE "craftbukkit-1.12.2.jar" AND ADD IT AS AN EXTERNAL LIBRARY.

EXPORT IT BY TYPING INTO THE "name" BOX "TREE.jar" AND MAKE SURE NOT TO EXPORT THE ".classpath" NOT THE ".project" FILES, BUT MAKE SURE TO EXPORT THE "plugin.yml" FILE!
